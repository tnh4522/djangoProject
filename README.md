## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store sensitive information:

```plaintext
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

### Database Configuration

By default, the project uses SQLite. To use a different database (e.g., PostgreSQL), update the `DATABASES` setting in `mydjangoapp/settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

## Running the Project

### Development

To run the project in a development environment, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Production

For production, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn, configured with a web server like Nginx. Update the settings in `mydjangoapp/settings.py` for production:

```python
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=['yourdomain.com']
```

## Testing

To run tests, use Django's built-in test framework:

1. **Run all tests:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```

2. **Check test coverage:**

   Install `coverage` and run:

   ```bash
   pip install coverage
   coverage run manage.py test
   coverage report
   ```

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to MyDjangoApp, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
